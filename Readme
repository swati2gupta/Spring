What is Spring IOC?

Instead of creating objects in the class where we need to use them, we create them in a different place(beans.xml) and use them whenver 
we need them.

The lifecycle of spring beans is managed by spring container which takes away the burden from the programmer to create and 
worry about the lifecycle of objects.
